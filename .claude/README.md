# .claude/ Directory

This directory contains configuration files for AI assistants (like Claude Code) working on the Meow Now project.

## Files

### CLAUDE.md
- **Purpose**: Project overview and quick reference
- **Contains**: Architecture, common tasks, environment setup, testing procedures
- **Use**: Read this first to understand the project

### RULES.md
- **Purpose**: Development rules and operational guidelines
- **Contains**: Priority-based rules (Critical, Important, Recommended)
- **Use**: Follow these rules when making changes

## Inspired By

These files follow the [SuperClaude framework](https://github.com/NomenAK/SuperClaude) pattern for enhanced AI assistant development workflows.

### Key Principles

1. **Context Offloading**: Use GitHub Issues for detailed tracking
2. **Evidence-Based**: Look up official docs before suggesting
3. **Task Management**: Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
4. **Parallel Operations**: Batch independent tool calls
5. **Professional Standards**: Follow priority-based rules

## For AI Assistants

When working on this project:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` first for project context
2. Follow rules in `RULES.md` with priority awareness
3. Check `GITHUB_ISSUES.md` for current roadmap
4. Use `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical details
5. Track progress with TodoWrite for 3+ task items

## For Humans

These files help AI assistants:
- Understand the project quickly
- Follow consistent development patterns
- Make better decisions
- Maintain code quality
- Track work systematically

You don't need to read these files, but they contain useful project information and conventions that AI assistants will follow.
